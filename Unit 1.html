        <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business?</h3>
        
            <p>IT has many purposes and benefits in modern business:</p>

            <p><b>Communication with customers.</b>  With technology constantly evolving globally, being accessible  to a wide audience around the world, communication between business to consumer has become so much easier. Tools such as Apps, internet, mobile and tablet devices, smart TV, etc, have made it so much easier for big businesses  to target and communicate effectively to their desired target audience.</p>
            
            <p><b>Efficiency of operation.</b> IT has taken over a lot of human data entry jobs because of its capability to retain accurate data, manipulate data and storage space of data. Unlike humans, IT systems are very cost effective, adaptable and user friendly. Majority businesses that invest heavily in modern IT tend to see an increase in operation and profitability.</p>
            
            <p><b>Business culture and class relations.</b> Through social media and networking sites, IT has allowed business to understand different cultures, beliefs, backgrounds  far better. This allows interactions between B2C to remain strong, causing less offence, distrust or tension.</p>
            
            <p><b>Security.</b> Many businesses, like banks, implement IT to improve security to keep their customers at ease. Strong security builds better rapport and trust amongst customers. Therefore, businesses are willing to spend a lot of cash to protect  their brand, product, service, data and customer.</p>
            
            <p><b>Research.</b> Although IT is very cost effective, Its greatest tool is the ability to market research customers a lot better and accurately. This can be done via internal data storage or internet. Either way, research via IT allows businesses to make better, successful decisions.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
        
            <p>There are 5 methods and skills needed to complete a successful projects:</p>

            <p><b>Scoping. </b>This is a session for brainstorming ideas. This is done by listing business objectives and understanding the requirements and needs.</p>
            
            <p><b>Planning. </b>This involves looking back at the idea and requirements given in the scoping session, and carefully structuring a way to execute the overall objective to client satisfaction.</p>
            
            <p><b>Development. </b>This is where the implementation of the client's idea begins. The frontend and backend work side by side to bring the vision to life. Key stakeholders are brought in to revise and polish up the development stage, before it’s sent for testing.</p>
            
            <p><b>Testing and deployment. </b>This is the final stage before the product is launched to the end-user. This is a critical stage, because any issues can be resolved before being launched.</p>
            
            <p><b>Maintenance. </b>This ensures once the product is live it's kept fully functional and stable. This means debug fixes and constant observation to ensure the product remains live and healthy.</p>
            
            <p>The above methods require problem-solving, good negotiation, attention to detail, relationship building, reporting and organisational skills.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h3>
        
            <p>When creating a website or performing any IT related task, Trello is the service i would use to plan and carry out tasks. To create a new project I would create a new board called Web development. Then I will create three titles called To-do, Doing and Done. To know exactly what needs to be done, I will brainstorm a list of tasks required to create my website by adding cards to my To-do column. Once I complete my brainstorm session, I will customise each card by including description, activity notes, creating sub checklists, including labels to highlight very important tasks and add any due dates. If this project involves working in a team, i will invite members to add their input of tasks or things i may have missed. As i’m starting each task i will move the card to the Doing column. Once completed, I will shift each card to the done column.</p>

        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
        
            <p>The most common reasons why projects fail are:</p>

            <p><b>Cost-cutting Approaches. </b>All businesses want to save money. When buying IT software for digital projects it’s important to find the balance between value for money and does the product allow full function to achieve overall objective. Buying a cheaper software may save the business money but may not operate to the requirements and objective needed.</p>
            
            <p><b>Lack of Proper Planning. </b>Many IT projects are started without having a thorough understanding of the scope and an end project outcome. Any project would fail if the targets are unclear and everything is managed in a disorganised manner. Poor planning leads to unclear objective, confusion of responsibilities, poor utilisation of resources, incorrect time estimates, incorrect cost estimates and poor performance.</p>
            
            <p><b>Selection of Technologies. </b>Wise selection of technologies prevents technical failure of the project. Once you have understood the ‘why’ and ‘what’ of the problem, you can proceed to unfold ‘how’ of the solution. A project can fail technically if you select a programme that does not align with your objective.</p>
            
            <p><b>Failure to Manage Scope. </b>It's common for new ideas to be suggested when developing a product but it’s very important to not lose focus on the brainstormed scope. There is always room for improvement. This approach can be disastrous for your project if you keep on improving without having the base completed.</p>
            
            <p><b>Poor communication. </b>Effective and efficient communication with stakeholders, management and the project team is vital for the success of a project. Common communication mistakes in IT projects occur when some team members are not kept in the communication loop. There are several team communication tools available to facilitate the communication between teams assigned on a single project such as Slack.</p>

            <p><b>Little Testing. </b>Software products can utterly fail if you skip the testing phase or keep it for the end. A regular and diligent testing process is essential to ensure delivery of a quality product to the customer.</p>

        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
        
            <p>Firstly, it is very important to understand the overall business objectives. This is done by listing all business goals and requirements. To do this, I will seek input from all relevant stakeholders. </p>

            <p>Secondly, research similar businesses to gain an idea of what IT systems are being used. This is very important because a basic understanding of cost, competition and industry requirement will be obtained to make the selection process a lot smoother. </p>

            <p>Thirdly, gather a list of potential IT systems that meet business objectives and market research. This list will be helpful to compare brands and models specification, while ensuring value for money.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, Conduct a analysis on the advantages and disadvantages of the selected IT system and its sustainability against new  systems being released in the future. Also, if it can handle the business current and future objectives. It’s also necessary to check  initial one-time costs, ongoing licensing, maintenance and support costs – against the business budget.</p>

            <p>Lastly, updating senior leaders is something to consider. Informing them of the selection process, how the decision came about, then getting their feedback on any missed criteria would be vital.</p>

        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve  your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h3>                

        <p>Being able to create cards and lists on Trello is a great assistance. It helps organise and keep track of task progress. Any new task given was easy to complete by just updating the Trello task list and carefully reorganising when each task was required to be completed.</p>

        <p>Git and GitHub helps developers track and manage changes to a digital project. As our web development project grew, version control became essential. Without affecting original codes, it was safe and efficient to use both tools to branch and merge codes. Branching, allowed the project to duplicate part of the source code, then safely make changes to that part without affecting the rest of the project. Once completed, the codes were merged back into the main source code to make it official.</p>

        <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
        
            <p>GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation. The impact GDPR has on projects is through how data is processed, data is accessed, consent obtained and penalties issued by ICO.</p>
        
            <p><b>Penalties for non-compliance. </b>Digital projects cannot afford to ignore GDPR, as the regulation includes heavy punishments. With fines of up to €20 million, or 4% of your total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher.</p>
            
            <p><b>GDPR’s impact on obtaining consent. </b>Methods digital Projects use to obtain consent are active opt-in, documents stating what individuals data will be processed for, consent requests - which should be separated from terms and conditions,  preconditioned consent - before use of service and product and lastly clarity to the individual who will be processing their data including any third-parties.</p>
        
            <p><b>GDPR’s impact on data access. </b>GDPR’s impact on data access.</p>
        
            <p><b>GDPR’s impact on data processing. </b>Via laws created by the ICO (information commissioner office, digital projects must <i>“Tell people they have the right to withdraw their consent at any time, and how to do this. It must be as easy to withdraw as it was to give consent”</i>. This means a simple and effective withdrawal mechanism is needed in place.</p>
