        <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3>
            
        <p>CodePen is great for testing out bugs, simple to use with html , css and javascript languages, it allows you to learn new syntaxes in an open-source environment and has some awesome features to write codes faster.</p>

        <p>Jumping from Codepen to Visual Studio, there were a lot of positive similarities. My preference for web designing would be VS because it obtains a better and simpler debugging feature,  testing is more rigorous and keeps coding a lot more accurate with its auto suggestion functionality.</p>

        <p>Trello is a very good tool because it improves the overall organisation of web projects. It has a very good progression meter feature, simple data filtering, keeps an accurate activity log and a great drag and drop functionality. Trello also has an invite feature, which allows the primary user to invite other members to view, edit or include their personal input to a project. This is helpful if a digital project includes other team members that need to be kept in the loop of its progression. This also offers good with effective communication. Its capability to resolve Task assignment  and avoidance of repetitive tasks can be time-consuming and also made this software very appropriate.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were Appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3>

        <p>Codepen and Trello were appropriate because of its simplicity to use as a new web designer. Navigating around both IDE was very straight forward. Also, having different colored code text was very helpful on the eye to read HTML , CSS and JavaScript better.</p>

        <p>Trello was exceptionally appropriate because of its ability to help organise tasks. Trello allows its user to create project folders and tasks folders. This is vital to keep track of project progression and how far from completion the project is. Trello is also appropriate for meeting deadlines, time management, very flexible, easy to use, good cloud storage and makes resolving issues a lot faster and easier.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>

        <p>Overall, I’m happy with the outcome of my first webpage. It took some time to grasp the fundamentals of coding, but with practice and a few errors, I was able to create a basic looking webpage. I strongly believe, with more time, further practice and continuous learning, my coding will improve, resulting in a better styled webpage through CSS coding. My key strength on this project was using Trello to organise my task. By nature, I sometimes forget important information, but the Trello platform allowed me to store key notes that I could reflect upon at later dates. I also found problem solving a lot of my errors to be a good strength of mine. Anytime I came across an issue, I was very determined to understand and resolve before moving on. If I were to make any changes, I would have liked to include some animation features. A weakness I found, some of my code was either repetitive or  previous codes override my classes created in CSS</p>

        <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>            
        
        <p>Although basic, my webpage is not very easy to use and easy to view. By learning more CSS codes, I would like to improve the styling and layout. I could have also improved the use of Git and GitHub. I found myself constantly changing original codes, which were later affected. Time was wasted trying to regain original codes, then trialing new codes again.  Researching specific codes on the internet was quite challenging for the first time. Understanding how to implement researched codes to me original code was puzzling but later became easier.</p>

        <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3> 

        <p>When preparing content for a web page, Trello was used to brainstorm ideas and list tasks needed to be completed before launch date.  Visual Studio was then used to create a basic html index page, followed by pages for outcome one, two and three. Once a structure was in place, CSS was implemented to style the page. Links were included, to navigate through different topics smoothly. Images were included, but required me to change format and adjust size to be compatible with the structure of the page. I now have an error free page, fit for purpose use.</p>
