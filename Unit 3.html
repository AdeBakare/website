        <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>

        <p>List of tools used to create my webpage were Trello, Visual Studio, Slack and GitHub. All were very beneficial because as a new coder it was easy to plan, easy to generate correct codes, easy to learn new codes and easy to make improvements to previous codes. Especially when support was needed, communicating relevant topics via topic related slacked channels allowed me to gain swift and accurate responses. The only drawback, the time it took to review syntax errors. I believe  Visual Studio or any other IDE should highlight the exact place and type of error more efficiently and readable to understand.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
        
        <p>Understanding and learning all features of Slack, Trello, Git and GitHub will definitely improve productivity and efficiency. Understanding the basics saved a lot of time.  Constantly using all tools for future projects will reduce errors, time wasting and  asking repetitive questions. Also, having a list of helpful coding websites can help. Forgetting coding syntax was a problem. Having useful website like w3school or MDN improves efficiency by reducing syntax errors. Also, taking a bit more time planning my task would improve productivity. Via Trello, having a well structured to-do, doing and done section, by adding due dates would have massively improved efficiency.  Including scheduled dates would have allowed me to concentrate more on the quality of my web pages, knowing I'm ahead of schedule.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>

        <p>Next time I will find a better brainstorm technique. At the beginning, I didn’t fully understand the clients’ needs. Some aspects of the brief were forgotten. Therefore, time was wasted trying to plan and create the webpage. This forced me to go back to the client requesting further information. Slack has many beneficial features, especially for group activities, but I feel I didn’t utilise it well. More communication on slack, even brainstorming on it may have helped. That way, the information given would have been accessible to me at any time to reflect upon. </p>

        <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
        
        <p>For every line of code written, I would constantly check the index.html browser to view what I’ve done. This will help assist me to identify issues in my code quicker. If the line of code does not reflect the code written or no changes were implemented, this is my indicator something is wrong.</p>
